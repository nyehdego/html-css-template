    <h2>Personas and Storyboarding: The Vending Machine</h2>
    <div class ="project">
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>Step into a userâ€™s shoes. Let's observe real user's interactions with with an interface,
            and interview them about their experiences. Today, we are exploring interactions with vending machines.
            Afterwards, we will create personas using our observations and storyboard our persona's experience, all to understand our interface.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>The Vending Machine</h3>
    <p>Vending machines are a common sight around college campuses, and many students make the time to go grab their favorite snack. Although interacting seems simple, what do we find when we pay closer attention to interactions with them? 
        Here is a sketch of a vending machine from the Sciences Library at Brown University.</p>

    <h4>Vending Machine Sketch and Annotation</h4>

    <h4>What can we say about this interface?</h4>
    <p>This interface is built to help users easily identify and choose a variety of items through snack labels.
        It also tries to provide clear instructions for vending and transaction methods with a screen displaying these instructions,
        and labels for the various components.
    </p>

    <h2>Observing Interactions</h2>
    <h3>Let's observe interactions of three (or four) people have with the vending machine </h3>
    <div class="input-sections">
        <div class="input-section">
          <h4>Andrew</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Stands there looking the machine up and down</li>
            <li>Leaves the vending machine for a second, to then come back to it</li>
            <li>Types in different product codes and looks at the prices</li>
            <li>Seems to type in product codes to check the prices</li>
            <li>Goes back to just looking at the options while literally tapping his foot</li>
            <li>Leaves the vending machine after a bit more time</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Ryan</h4>

            <li>Types in product codes to check prices</li>
            <li>Walks away while staring back at the vending machine, but then comes back</li>
            <li>Leaves again, with a stressed look on his face</li>

          <h4>Eliana and Alina</h4>

            <li>Eliana swipes her school card</li>
            <li>Eliana and Alina bend down to read the small screen</li>
            <li>Eliana swipes twice more</li>
            <li>They go to a neighboring vending machine, and leave with a snack</li>

      <h2>Interviewing Users</h2>
      <h3>Now, let's interview the users we observed, with specific questions to try to remove potential answer biases</h3>

          <div class="input-section">

            <ul>
              <li>'A system with snacks and labels to type in somewhere on a keypad.'</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>'The prices stood out more so than the interface. It was self-explanatory.'</li>

            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>'Nothing about the machine, no. Just the prices.'</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>If you could change one thing about this interface, what would it be? (To enourge feedback without making assumptions)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>'It'd be less work to have the prices already under the item.'</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>How would you explain how to use this interface to someone who's never used it before? (Reveals what users find important or challenging without asking directly)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>'Look at the food you want, go to the keypad and press in its number, then swipe your card or pay cash.'</li>

              <ul>
                <li>'The way they prompted the keypad was locked. It didn't let you know beforehand, so it locked you out after trying, and then would revert back to the original screen as if it's working fine.'</li>

                    this persona, where users expect simple interactions and feel frustration when the machine fails to deliver quickly.</li>
